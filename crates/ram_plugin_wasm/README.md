This crate provides the interface for implementing RAM plugins using the
[`WebAssembly Component Model`](https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/introduction.html). Plugins can be loaded dynamically at runtime and
provide custom instructions to the RAM virtual machine.

> [!CAUTION]
> The plugin functionality is very experimental and exploratory at this stage.
