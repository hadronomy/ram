## About This Project

This project aims to develop a complete ecosystem for the Random Access Machine (RAM) model of computation. `RAM` provides both a formally defined **language** based on this model and a robust **emulator** to execute programs written in that language.

### Objectives

*   **Formal Language Definition:** Define a clear, consistent, and unambiguous specification for the RAM programming language.
*   **Accurate Emulation:** Implement an emulator that faithfully executes RAM programs according to the defined semantics.
*   **Performance:** Strive for reasonable performance in the emulator to handle non-trivial programs.
*   **Educational Resource:** Serve as a practical tool and codebase for learning about the RAM model, theoretical computer science concepts, and potentially compiler/interpreter design.
*   **(Future) LLVM Backend:** Explore replacing the emulator with an LLVM-based backend for potentially higher performance code generation.
*   **(Future) Extensibility:** Design the core components with potential future extensions in mind, such as debugging tools, visualization, or integration with other systems.

> [!CAUTION]
> This project is under heavy development
> It's not in any way stable or even functional in some cases.
> **Until the first release** the `main` branch is not guaranteed
> to work in any way.

## Requirements

- mise - [Installation](https://mise.jdx.dev)
- mold - [Installation](https://github.com/rui314/mold)
- rustup/cargo - [Installation](https://rustup.rs)

`mise` Is used to manage the project dependencies and environment.
To ensure that you have the needed tools installed, run the following command:

```bash
mise trust
mise install
```

## Compilation Pipeline

The RAM compiler follows a multi-stage pipeline to transform source code into executable instructions. The following diagrams illustrate the compilation process from different perspectives.

### Pipeline Stages

1.  **Lexer** (`ram_parser::lexer`): Initiates the process by scanning the raw source code text and breaking it down into a sequence of fundamental tokens, such as keywords, identifiers, literals, and operators.

2.  **Parser** (`ram_parser::parser`): Takes the stream of tokens generated by the lexer and applies grammatical rules (using recursive descent) to construct a structured representation of the program.

3.  **CST** (Concrete Syntax Tree): Produces a detailed, lossless tree that mirrors the original source code structure precisely, including elements like whitespace and comments. This fidelity is crucial for tasks like code formatting.

4.  **AST** (Abstract Syntax Tree): Transforms the CST into a more abstract representation, discarding purely syntactic details and focusing on the program's logical structure and meaning.

5.  **ItemTree** (`hir_def::item_tree`): Creates a higher-level view by extracting key definitions like modules and labels from the AST, essentially providing a structural map or outline of the program.

6.  **HIR** (High-level Intermediate Representation): Elevates the AST into a semantically richer form. This representation incorporates resolved names, initial type information, and other details necessary for deeper analysis.

7.  **Analysis Pipeline** (`hir_analysis::pipeline`): Executes a sequence of analysis passes over the HIR to validate the program's correctness and gather further insights:
    *   **Control Flow Analysis**: Maps out the possible execution paths within the program.
    *   **Data Flow Analysis**: Tracks the origin, movement, and usage of data throughout the code.
    *   **Instruction Validation**: Verifies that all instructions are well-formed and used according to the language rules.

8.  **VM Program** (`ram_vm::program`): Translates the analyzed HIR into a format specifically designed for execution by the target virtual machine.

9.  **Virtual Machine Execution** (`ram_vm::vm`): The final stage where the VM interprets the generated program, executing instructions sequentially and manipulating the virtual machine's memory and registers to run the code.
