## Compilation Pipeline

The RAM compiler follows a multi-stage pipeline to transform source code into executable instructions:

1. **Lexer**: Scans the raw source code text and breaks it down into tokens (keywords, identifiers, literals, operators)
2. **Parser**: Applies grammatical rules to construct a structured representation of the program
3. **Concrete Syntax Tree (CST)**: A detailed, lossless tree that mirrors the original source code structure
4. **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)**: A simplified tree that represents the semantic structure of the program
5. **ItemTree**: Extracts definitions from the AST
6. **High-level Intermediate Representation (HIR)**: A semantic representation of the program
7. **Analysis Pipeline**: Performs various analyses on the HIR, including control flow analysis, data flow analysis, and instruction validation
8. **VM Program**: Translates the analyzed HIR into a format for execution by the virtual machine
9. **Virtual Machine Execution**: The VM interprets the generated program, executing instructions sequentially

## Execution Process

When you run a RAM program, the following steps occur:

1. The source code is read from the file
2. The code is parsed and transformed through the compilation pipeline
3. The resulting VM program is loaded into the virtual machine
4. The VM initializes its memory and registers
5. The VM executes instructions one by one, updating memory and registers as needed
6. Execution continues until a HALT instruction is encountered or an error occurs
7. The final state of memory and any output produced are returned

## Control Flow

The execution of a RAM program is normally sequential, with instructions executed in order. However, control flow can be altered using jump instructions:

- `JUMP label`: Unconditionally jumps to the specified label
- `JGTZ label`: Jumps to the label if the accumulator is greater than zero
- `JZERO label`: Jumps to the label if the accumulator is zero
- `JNEG label`: Jumps to the label if the accumulator is negative

These instructions change the instruction pointer, causing execution to continue from a different point in the program.

## Error Handling

During execution, various errors can occur:

- **Syntax errors**: Detected during parsing (e.g., invalid instruction format)
- **Semantic errors**: Detected during analysis (e.g., undefined label)
- **Runtime errors**: Detected during execution (e.g., division by zero)

When an error is detected, execution is typically halted, and an error message is displayed.

## Debugging

The RAM VM provides several features to help with debugging:

- Detailed error messages with line and column information
- Memory state inspection
- Step-by-step execution
- Control flow visualization

These features can be accessed through the CLI or programmatically.

## Example

Here's an example of how a simple RAM program is executed:

```
# Calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 5
        LOAD =0     # Initialize sum to 0
        STORE 1     # Store sum in address 1
        LOAD =1     # Initialize counter to 1
        STORE 2     # Store counter in address 2
loop:   LOAD 2      # Load counter
        JGTZ cont   # If counter > 0, continue
        JUMP end    # Otherwise, jump to end
cont:   LOAD 1      # Load current sum
        ADD 2       # Add counter to sum
        STORE 1     # Store updated sum
        LOAD 2      # Load counter
        SUB =1      # Decrement counter
        STORE 2     # Store updated counter
        JUMP loop   # Repeat
end:    HALT        # Stop execution
```

Execution trace:

1. Initialize sum (address 1) to 0
2. Initialize counter (address 2) to 5
3. Load counter (5) into accumulator
4. Since accumulator > 0, continue to `cont`
5. Load sum (0) into accumulator
6. Add counter (5) to accumulator, resulting in 5
7. Store updated sum (5) in address 1
8. Load counter (5) into accumulator
9. Subtract 1, resulting in 4
10. Store updated counter (4) in address 2
11. Jump back to `loop`
12. ... (repeat steps 3-11 with decreasing counter values)
13. Eventually, counter becomes 0
14. Jump to `end`
15. Halt execution

After execution, address 1 contains 15 (the sum of numbers from 1 to 5).

  The RAM VM is designed to provide a balance between faithfulness to the theoretical model and practical usability. The execution model is simple enough to understand but powerful enough to implement complex algorithms.
