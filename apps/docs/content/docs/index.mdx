## What is the Random Access Machine Model?

The Random Access Machine is a theoretical model of computation used in computer science to analyze algorithms. It consists of:

- A program made up of sequentially numbered instructions
- A set of registers that can store arbitrary integers
- Basic operations like arithmetic, conditional branching, and memory access

This model is particularly useful for teaching computational theory and algorithm analysis, as it provides a simplified abstraction of how computers work at a fundamental level.

## Project Objectives

The RAM project aims to achieve several key objectives:

<Cards>
  <Card title="Formal Language Definition" icon="code">
    Define a clear, consistent, and unambiguous specification for the RAM programming language.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Accurate Emulation" icon="cpu">
    Implement an emulator that faithfully executes RAM programs according to the defined semantics.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Performance" icon="zap">
    Strive for reasonable performance in the emulator to handle non-trivial programs.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Educational Resource" icon="book">
    Serve as a practical tool for learning about theoretical computer science concepts.
