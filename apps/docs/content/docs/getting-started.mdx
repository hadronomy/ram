## Installation

RAM is available as an npm package. You can install it globally using npm, yarn, or pnpm.

### Using npm

```bash
npm install -g @ramlang/cli
```

### Using yarn

```bash
yarn global add @ramlang/cli
```

### Using pnpm

```bash
pnpm add -g @ramlang/cli
```

After installation, you should have access to the `ram` command in your terminal.

## Verifying Installation

To verify that RAM is installed correctly, run:

```bash
ram --version
```

You should see the version number of the installed RAM CLI.

## Your First RAM Program

Let's create a simple RAM program that adds two numbers. Create a file named `add.ram` with the following content:

```
# Simple RAM program that adds two numbers
LOAD 1    # Load value from address 1
ADD 2     # Add value from address 2
STORE 3   # Store result in address 3
HALT      # Stop execution
```

### Understanding the Program

This program performs the following operations:

1. `LOAD 1`: Loads the value stored at memory address 1 into the accumulator
2. `ADD 2`: Adds the value stored at memory address 2 to the accumulator
3. `STORE 3`: Stores the result (now in the accumulator) to memory address 3
4. `HALT`: Stops the program execution

### Running the Program

To run the program, use the `ram run` command:

```bash
ram run add.ram
```

By default, the memory locations are initialized to 0. To provide input values, you can use the `--memory` flag:

```bash
ram run add.ram --memory "1=5,2=7"
```

This sets memory address 1 to 5 and memory address 2 to 7. After running the program, memory address 3 should contain 12 (the sum of 5 and 7).

## Next Steps

Now that you've written and run your first RAM program, you can:

- Learn more about the [RAM language syntax](/docs/language/syntax)
- Explore the available [instructions](/docs/language/instructions)
- Check out more complex [examples](/docs/examples/basic)

<Callout type="tip">
  The RAM language is designed to be simple yet powerful. As you become more familiar with it, you'll be able to write increasingly complex programs to solve a variety of computational problems.
