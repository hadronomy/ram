## Addition

This program adds two numbers stored in memory addresses 1 and 2, and stores the result in address 3:

```
# Add two numbers
        LOAD 1      # Load the value from address 1
        ADD 2       # Add the value from address 2
        STORE 3     # Store the result in address 3
        HALT        # Stop execution
```

To run this program with specific input values:

```bash
ram run add.ram --memory "1=5,2=7"
```

After execution, memory address 3 will contain 12.

## Subtraction

This program subtracts the number in address 2 from the number in address 1, and stores the result in address 3:

```
# Subtract two numbers
        LOAD 1      # Load the value from address 1
        SUB 2       # Subtract the value from address 2
        STORE 3     # Store the result in address 3
        HALT        # Stop execution
```

## Multiplication

This program multiplies two numbers stored in addresses 1 and 2, and stores the result in address 3:

```
# Multiply two numbers
        LOAD 1      # Load the value from address 1
        MUL 2       # Multiply by the value from address 2
        STORE 3     # Store the result in address 3
        HALT        # Stop execution
```

## Division

This program divides the number in address 1 by the number in address 2, and stores the result in address 3:

```
# Divide two numbers
        LOAD 1      # Load the value from address 1
        DIV 2       # Divide by the value from address 2
        STORE 3     # Store the result in address 3
        HALT        # Stop execution
```

## Swap

This program swaps the values stored in addresses 1 and 2:

```
# Swap two values
        LOAD 1      # Load the value from address 1
        STORE 3     # Store it temporarily in address 3
        LOAD 2      # Load the value from address 2
        STORE 1     # Store it in address 1
        LOAD 3      # Load the temporary value
        STORE 2     # Store it in address 2
        HALT        # Stop execution
```

## Absolute Value

This program calculates the absolute value of the number stored in address 1 and stores the result in address 2:

```
# Calculate absolute value
        LOAD 1      # Load the value from address 1
        JGTZ pos    # If it's positive, jump to 'pos'
        JZERO pos   # If it's zero, jump to 'pos'
        MUL =-1     # Otherwise, multiply by -1
pos:    STORE 2     # Store the result in address 2
        HALT        # Stop execution
```

## Counting

This program counts from 1 to the value stored in address 1, storing each value in consecutive memory locations starting from address 2:

```
# Count from 1 to N
        LOAD =1     # Initialize counter to 1
        STORE 2     # Store counter in first output location
loop:   LOAD 2      # Load current counter
        SUB 1       # Compare with target value
        JZERO end   # If equal, we're done
        LOAD 2      # Load current counter
        ADD =1      # Increment counter
        STORE 2     # Update counter
        STORE 2[1]  # Store in next output location
        JUMP loop   # Repeat
end:    HALT        # Stop execution
```

## Maximum

This program finds the maximum of two numbers stored in addresses 1 and 2, and stores the result in address 3:

```
# Find maximum of two numbers
        LOAD 1      # Load first number
        SUB 2       # Subtract second number
        JGTZ first  # If result > 0, first is larger
        LOAD 2      # Otherwise, load second number
        JUMP store  # Jump to store
first:  LOAD 1      # Load first number
store:  STORE 3     # Store the maximum in address 3
        HALT        # Stop execution
```

## Minimum

This program finds the minimum of two numbers stored in addresses 1 and 2, and stores the result in address 3:

```
# Find minimum of two numbers
        LOAD 1      # Load first number
        SUB 2       # Subtract second number
        JGTZ second # If result > 0, second is smaller
        LOAD 1      # Otherwise, load first number
        JUMP store  # Jump to store
second: LOAD 2      # Load second number
store:  STORE 3     # Store the minimum in address 3
        HALT        # Stop execution
```

## Sum of Array

This program calculates the sum of an array of numbers. Address 1 contains the length of the array, and the array elements are stored starting from address 2:

```
# Calculate sum of array
        LOAD =0     # Initialize sum to 0
        STORE 10    # Store sum in address 10
        LOAD 1      # Load array length
        STORE 11    # Store length in address 11
        LOAD =0     # Initialize index to 0
        STORE 12    # Store index in address 12
loop:   LOAD 12     # Load current index
        SUB 11      # Compare with array length
        JZERO end   # If equal, we're done
        LOAD 10     # Load current sum
        ADD 2[12]   # Add array element at current index
        STORE 10    # Update sum
        LOAD 12     # Load current index
        ADD =1      # Increment index
        STORE 12    # Update index
        JUMP loop   # Repeat
end:    HALT        # Stop execution
```
