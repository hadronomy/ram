## Arithmetic Instructions

These instructions perform arithmetic operations on the accumulator (R0).

| Instruction | Description | Example |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| `ADD x` | Add the value at address x to the accumulator | `ADD 1` |
| `SUB x` | Subtract the value at address x from the accumulator | `SUB 2` |
| `MUL x` | Multiply the accumulator by the value at address x | `MUL 3` |
| `DIV x` | Divide the accumulator by the value at address x | `DIV 4` |
| `MOD x` | Set the accumulator to the remainder of division by the value at address x | `MOD 5` |

## Memory Instructions

These instructions are used to move data between memory and the accumulator.

| Instruction | Description | Example |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| `LOAD x` | Load the value from address x into the accumulator | `LOAD 1` |
| `STORE x` | Store the value in the accumulator to address x | `STORE 2` |
| `CLEAR` | Set the accumulator to zero | `CLEAR` |

## Control Flow Instructions

These instructions control the flow of execution in the program.

| Instruction | Description | Example |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| `JUMP x` | Jump to the instruction with label x | `JUMP loop` |
| `JGTZ x` | Jump to x if the accumulator is greater than zero | `JGTZ positive` |
| `JZERO x` | Jump to x if the accumulator is zero | `JZERO zero` |
| `JNEG x` | Jump to x if the accumulator is negative | `JNEG negative` |
| `HALT` | Stop program execution | `HALT` |

## Input/Output Instructions

These instructions handle input and output operations.

| Instruction | Description | Example |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| `READ x` | Read a value from input and store it at address x | `READ 1` |
| `WRITE x` | Write the value at address x to output | `WRITE 2` |

## Register Instructions

These instructions operate on specific registers.

| Instruction | Description | Example |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| `LOAD Rx` | Load the value from register x into the accumulator | `LOAD R1` |
| `STORE Rx` | Store the value in the accumulator to register x | `STORE R2` |

## Advanced Instructions

These instructions provide additional functionality for more complex programs.

| Instruction | Description | Example |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| `AND x` | Bitwise AND the accumulator with the value at address x | `AND 1` |
| `OR x` | Bitwise OR the accumulator with the value at address x | `OR 2` |
| `XOR x` | Bitwise XOR the accumulator with the value at address x | `XOR 3` |
| `NOT` | Bitwise NOT the accumulator | `NOT` |
| `SHL x` | Shift the accumulator left by x bits | `SHL 1` |
| `SHR x` | Shift the accumulator right by x bits | `SHR 2` |

## Example Program

Here's an example program that uses several of these instructions:

```
# Calculate the factorial of the value at address 1
# and store the result at address 2
        LOAD 1      # Load the input value
        STORE 3     # Store a copy in address 3 (counter)
        LOAD =1     # Initialize the result to 1
        STORE 2     # Store the initial result
loop:   LOAD 3      # Load the counter
        JZERO end   # If counter is zero, we're done
        LOAD 2      # Load the current result
        MUL 3       # Multiply by the counter
        STORE 2     # Store the new result
        LOAD 3      # Load the counter
        SUB =1      # Decrement the counter
        STORE 3     # Store the updated counter
        JUMP loop   # Repeat
end:    HALT        # Stop execution
```

This program calculates the factorial of the value stored at address 1 and stores the result at address 2.
