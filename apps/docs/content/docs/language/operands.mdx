## Addressing Modes

### Direct Addressing

Direct addressing refers to a memory location directly. The operand specifies the address to access:

```
LOAD 5      # Load the value from memory address 5
```

### Indirect Addressing

Indirect addressing uses the value at a memory location as the address to access. This is indicated by an asterisk (`*`) before the operand:

```
LOAD *5     # Load the value from the address stored at memory address 5
```

For example, if memory address 5 contains the value 10, then `LOAD *5` will load the value from memory address 10.

### Immediate Addressing

Immediate addressing uses the operand value directly, rather than treating it as an address. This is indicated by an equals sign (`=`) before the operand:

```
LOAD =5     # Load the value 5 directly into the accumulator
```

### Register Addressing

Register addressing refers to a specific register. This is indicated by the letter 'R' followed by the register number:

```
LOAD R1     # Load the value from register 1
```

The accumulator is register R0, so `LOAD R0` is equivalent to loading the accumulator's value into itself.

## Array Access

RAM supports array-like access with the syntax `base[index]`:

```
LOAD 5[3]   # Load the value from memory address (5 + 3)
```

This is equivalent to `LOAD 8` in this case.

You can combine array access with other addressing modes:

```
LOAD *5[3]  # Load the value from the address stored at memory address (5 + 3)
LOAD =5[3]  # Load the value 8 directly (5 + 3)
```

## Label References

Labels can be used as operands in jump instructions:

```
loop:   LOAD 1
        ADD 2
        STORE 3
        JUMP loop   # Jump back to the 'loop' label
```

## Expressions

Some RAM implementations support simple expressions as operands:

```
LOAD =(5 + 3)   # Load the value 8 directly
```

However, this feature may not be available in all implementations.

## Examples

Here are some examples of different addressing modes in action:

```
# Direct addressing
LOAD 5      # Load the value from memory address 5
STORE 10    # Store the accumulator value to memory address 10

# Indirect addressing
LOAD *5     # Load the value from the address stored at memory address 5
STORE *10   # Store the accumulator value to the address stored at memory address 10

# Immediate addressing
LOAD =5     # Load the value 5 directly into the accumulator
ADD =10     # Add the value 10 directly to the accumulator

# Register addressing
LOAD R1     # Load the value from register 1
STORE R2    # Store the accumulator value to register 2

# Array access
LOAD 5[3]   # Load the value from memory address (5 + 3)
STORE 10[R1]  # Store the accumulator value to memory address (10 + value in R1)
```
