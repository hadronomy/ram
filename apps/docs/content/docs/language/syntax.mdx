## Program Structure

A RAM program consists of a sequence of lines, each containing one of the following:

- An instruction (optionally preceded by a label)
- A label definition
- A comment
- A module declaration or import statement

### Example

```
# This is a comment
start:  LOAD 1      # This loads the value at address 1
        ADD 2       # Add the value at address 2
        STORE 3     # Store the result in address 3
loop:   LOAD 3      # Load the result
        SUB 1       # Subtract 1
        JGTZ end    # Jump to 'end' if the result is greater than zero
        JUMP loop   # Jump back to 'loop'
end:    HALT        # Stop execution
```

## Comments

Comments in RAM start with a `#` character and continue until the end of the line:

```
# This is a comment
LOAD 1  # This is also a comment
```

## Labels

Labels are identifiers that mark specific positions in the code. They can be used as targets for jump instructions:

```
start:  LOAD 1      # 'start' is a label
        JUMP start  # Jump back to the 'start' label
```

Labels must be followed by an instruction and can only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores.

## Instructions

Instructions are the basic building blocks of RAM programs. Each instruction consists of an opcode and, optionally, an operand:

```
LOAD 1      # Opcode: LOAD, Operand: 1
ADD 2       # Opcode: ADD, Operand: 2
HALT        # Opcode: HALT, No operand
```

See the [Instructions](/docs/language/instructions) page for a complete list of available instructions.

## Operands

Operands specify the data that instructions operate on. RAM supports several addressing modes:

```
LOAD 1      # Direct addressing: Load from address 1
LOAD *1     # Indirect addressing: Load from the address stored at address 1
LOAD =1     # Immediate addressing: Load the value 1 directly
```

See the [Operands](/docs/language/operands) page for more details on addressing modes.

## Modules

RAM supports a module system similar to Rust's, allowing you to organize your code into separate files:

```
mod mymodule;       # Declare a module
use mymodule::*;    # Import all items from a module
```

See the [Modules](/docs/language/modules) page for more information on the module system.

## Whitespace and Formatting

RAM is not sensitive to whitespace, except for separating tokens. You can use spaces and tabs for indentation according to your preference.

## Case Sensitivity

RAM is case-sensitive. For example, `LOAD` and `load` are considered different instructions.

## Line Continuation

RAM does not support line continuation. Each instruction must be on a single line.
